# US_Healthcare_Analysis
SUMMARY:
This project harnesses a diverse array of Power BI skills to analyze and visualize data from the healthcare industry. Leveraging the robust capabilities of Power BI, including DAX calculations, data cleaning, transformation, and other essential skills, the dashboard provides stakeholders with comprehensive insights into various facets of healthcare.

Through the application of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), the dashboard calculates key metrics and custom measures, enabling in-depth analysis of patient demographics, hospital performance, and payer-provider dynamics. Additionally, meticulous data cleaning and transformation processes ensure that the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

By incorporating interactive visualizations and dynamic filters, the dashboard empowers stakeholders to explore healthcare data effectively. From trend analysis to scenario modeling, stakeholders can utilize the dashboard's capabilities to make informed decisions and drive strategic initiatives in the healthcare sector.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of Power BI in transforming complex healthcare data into actionable insights, highlighting the importance of data-driven decision-making in improving healthcare outcomes and optimizing resource allocation.
